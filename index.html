        <h1> Hello! </h1>
        <!-- need to add image here -->
        <p>
        I'm a fifth year Informatics PhD student at University of California, Irvine, working in the <a href="https://depstein.net/pielab">PIE Lab</a> with <a href="https://depstein.net/">Prof. Daniel Epstein</a>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My research focus on <b>helping people to connect with each other effectively through using social technology for their social goals</b>, such as receiving social well-being or communication benefits. Specifically, I <b>study, build, and evaluate social technology that support the communication process of sharing activities</b> (e.g., hobbies and things people care about) which allow people to achieve their social well-being goals.
        <!-- after Research pages were done, could add a paragraph on past experience -->
        <br>
        <br>
        I apply a mixed-method approach to (1) <b>advance understanding</b> of people's practices and experience with the design of social media platform, (2) <b>design and build systems</b> based on the empirical evidence from these studies and theories, and (3) <b>conduct real-world field deployment studies</b> with the target communities to understand the impact of my design.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my doctoral work, I study the sharing of activities with personal tracking data on social media platforms. I argue that <b><i>when people are supported in aligning their sharing with the ideal practices or existing sharing norms of the platform, they will receive more desired sharing outcomes</i></b>.
