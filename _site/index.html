        As a human-computer interaction researcher, I focus on the intersection of Social Computing and Personal Informatics to study how to design and build social computing systems and computational-mediated environments incorporating personal informatics technology that leads to benefits in human well-being.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my research, I drawn a mixed methods approach, often incorporates system-building and empirical study in the field to grasp a sense of in-the-wild experience. I often (1) <b>advance understanding</b> of people's practices and experience with various social media platform design, (2) <b>design and build systems</b> based on the empirical evidence from these studies and theories, and (3) <b>conduct real-world field deployment studies</b> with the target communities to understand the impact of my design.

        In my doctoral work, I study the sharing of activities with personal tracking data on social media platforms. I argue that <b><i>when people are supported in aligning their sharing with the ideal practices or existing sharing norms of the platform, they will receive more desired sharing outcomes</i></b>.

        <!-- Sharing activities that people do in everyday life, such as physical activity, health management, or hobbies, help people receive benefits like social support and positive self-presentation. Short-form videos present new opportunities for activity-sharing, which has traditionally been studied in static contexts like text- and image-sharing. We therefore aim to understand what information people incorporate into short-form activity videos, and how. We qualitatively analyzed 420 short-form activity videos on TikTok across three domains: running, studying, and sketching. We found people often present information before, during, and after activities, developing strategies for qualitatively and quantitatively incorporating activity-relevant information in each. We also uncover practices for aligning the sharing of activity-relevant information with the nature of short-form videos, such as modifying broader-scale goals into video-scale goals. We further discuss design opportunities and challenges for designers to create tools that support the practice, such as closer integration with tracking tools and encouraging narrative structure.

        <!-- People often leverage multiple platforms to share activities they undertake in their lives, from music listening to eating. Broad-purpose platforms, which people use to share a wide variety of activities with a diverse audience, and dedicated platforms, which often focus on tracking and sharing a specific activity with connections with similar interests, both help individuals seeking social benefits from sharing their activity. Researchers designing systems for activity sharing have often reflected on whether to support sharing on dedicated or broad-purpose platforms, suggesting a need to better understand their relative utility. We collected and compared the responses received between 700,000 pairs of activity-sharing posts on four sets of broad-purpose and dedicated platforms across two domains: physical activity (Strava, MapMyRun) and creativity (Dribbble, Behance). Results showed that dedicated platforms were more likely to receive responses (likes and comments), and comments were more likely to be encouraging and refer to specific qualities of the activities being shared. We reflect on the tradeoff between sheer audience volume and likelihood of response, and discuss how to design prompts and templates into sharing features which better align with the norms of respective platforms.

        <!-- Sharing personal informatics data can support accountability, connectedness, and self-expression, but people often find their data too trivial to share on social media. Ephemeral social platforms like Snapchat and Story features have emerged as spaces for sharing more trivial life events, presenting an opportunity to incorporate self-tracked data into sharing. Past work suggests that including data-driven stickers on these platforms can help add additional context to what people share, but little is known about the benefits and challenges of people's everyday experiences with this concept. To understand people's everyday use of data-driven stickers, we designed and developed SnapPI, an app for flexibly incorporating data into stickers for Snapchat. We deployed SnapPI to 21 participants for two weeks, finding that participants value aligning data sharing with Snapchat's communication and stylistic norms. Perceiving Snapchat as a playful platform, participants connected data stickers with various visual components of their Snaps. Stickers were used to incorporate personal informatics data into their existing conversations, and were edited to align with different audience needs or to be expressive. We discuss recommendations for personal data sharing, suggesting supporting flexibility in presentation and aligning with the norms of existing platforms.

        <!-- Live streaming is an emergent social medium that allows remote interaction between the streamer and an audience of any size. Major live-streaming platforms in some Asian countries have a digital gift-giving feature that allows viewers to directly reward streamers during live sessions. Streamers can later exchange the digital gifts they have received for money, and this monetary incentive appears likely to influence how they interact with their viewers and generate live-streaming content. However, the precise nature and mechanisms of such impact have not previously been explored. Therefore, this qualitative study with 13 streamer participants examines how digital gifting influences streamers' motivations and the nature of both the content that they generate and their social interactions with their audiences. It reports that the digital-gifting function serves as a major incentive for active streaming, but may also disincentivize some streamers from continuing to contribute, for reasons that will be explored. Moreover, the participants devised strategies for both content generation and social interaction with the specific objective of earning gifts from viewers: practices that, in some cases, appeared to limit the quality of their live-streaming content. It was also noted that the streamers tended to have constrained social relationships with their viewers, in part because such relationships were seen as unequal or one-sided due to gift-giving behavior. The paper concludes with a discussion of design considerations for the incorporation of gift-giving features into live-streaming platforms, and additional recommendations for future research and the design of such platforms.

        <!-- Digital gifting in live streaming, in which viewers buy digital gifts to reward the streamers, was worth over $200 million in 2018 in China and its growth has been accelerating. This paper explores what motivates people to tip and how it impacts interactions between viewers and streamers. Through a survey, we identified the main categories of viewers' tipping motivations. We found that viewers were motivated by the reciprocal acts of streamers, who would engage in various types of social interactions with tippers during the live streams. The styles of interactions and contents of live stream based on the tipping are differently influenced by the motivations of viewers and streamers. For example, viewers often tip large to attract attentions from the crowd or promote preferred live-streaming content. These findings provide more knowledge on the social interaction in live streaming platforms.

        <!-- Children with developmental delayed can make progress through early intervention and training. However, from the interviews with occupational therapists and parents, we found that current training techniques lack variety and bore children in a short while. To improve the training effect, we proposed PinchFun, a cooperative game aiming to provide fine motor training for preschool children (under 6 years old) with developmental delay, in which the parent can cooperate with the child to achieve the game goals and adjust the game difficulty to meet different developmental milestones. The game employs the Leap motion controller and force-sensitive resistor (FSR) to detect the hand gesture and level of pressure of fingers. PinchFun integrates the physical assistive devices, i.e. clips and rubber band, and the virtual interactive game to optimize learning impact and gaming experience.
