    <h1>Social Computing for Well-being Lab</h1>

<p>Human beings are inherently social. While the rise of social technologies has given people countless ways to connect, express themselves, and build communities, widespread access doesn't guarantee positive outcomes. People are simultaneously exploring new opportunities for support and creative self-expression while navigating concerns about privacy, miscommunication, and conflict.</p>

<p>Our group researches how to design everyday social technology for social good—helping people stay connected, supported, and collaborative. We believe social technologies should inherently facilitate positive behaviors while preventing harm. We're dedicated to evaluating, designing, and building social technologies that support human values in real-world settings.</p>
    
<h3>Current Research Themes</h3>

<h4>Designing Tools or Computational Support for Navigating Online Norms for Social Media</h4>

<p>When using social media platforms to socialize, people invest large amount of effort in managing their impressions. This includes everything from their presence and language used in their interactions. Specifically, Social norms in digital environments heavily influence these self-presentation decisions. While structured spaces (Discord, Reddit, Facebook Groups) often have norms shaped by explicit rules and active moderation, most social media platforms create complex, less structured environments.</p>

<p>Current social media platforms aggregate users in multiple ways - through existing connections or algorithmic "semi-communities" that appear in social feeds. This leads to the <em>complexity and unpredictability in navigating self-presentation</em>. The layered nature of these displays often leads to <em>conflicts between users with different sharing goals and practices</em>, making communication less effective. Our goal is to make computationally-mediated environments places where people can engage positively.</p>

<h4>Understanding Diverse User Experiences in Online Platforms</h4>

<p>Social technology promised greater connection and resource sharing, but experiences vary significantly across populations. Platform affordances may lead people with different abilities to adopt platforms differently, sometimes creating barriers to usage.</p>

<p>People's backgrounds and goals across demographic groups influence how they adopt social technology—for example, vulnerable populations often seek platforms with stronger privacy protections. Understanding social technology usage across populations remains crucial. This requires careful study, thoughtful design, and reflection on current usage patterns while envisioning what should guide new system development.</p>

<h4>Reimagining Platform Design for Positive Outcome from Social Media Usage</h4>

<p>Social affordances built into platforms largely shape online interactions and relationships. While current designs help facilitate benefits like social support exchange and creative self-expression, they also create issues such as social comparison and oversimplified self-presentation.</p>

<p>As research explores alternative platform infrastructures, we can ask how different platforms or features might enable interactions that broaden social benefits while mitigating potential harms from online engagement.</p>
