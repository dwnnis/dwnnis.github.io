<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><em>(Updated: 2025/08/28)</em></p>

<p>For students that are interested in working with me, the following section may be useful for you:</p>

<ul>
    <li style="background-color: #C7EEFF;"><b>What is the type of research that you're doing?</b></li>
        <p>
            As a HCI researcher, I do research in the intersection of Social Computing and Personal Informatics. Understanding how social technology could benefit people in receiving social well-being benefits, as well as how it interplays with the use of self-tracking technology.

        </p>
    <li style="background-color: #C7EEFF;"><b>What is Human-Computer Interaction Research?</b></li>
        <p>
            My research field is in Human-Computer Interaction. Works conducted in this area are often diverse, as computing became a large concept that is deeply embedded in society. HCI works takes time and often requires a deep engagement with the human context that involves technology usage. For instance, you may be evaluating whether a LLM-enhanced workflow help scientific work, or how a group of user with mixed visual ability use social media. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In NYCU CS, we have a strong culture of doing HCI work, and I am fortunate to be surrounded by excellent scholars which you would also be very interested in checking if you’re interested in the field.
        </p>
    <li style="background-color: #C7EEFF;"><b>Where do you usually publish / aim to publish your work?</b></li>
        <p>
            I publish mainly in ACM SIGCHI Conferences and Journals (i.e., CHI, CSCW). 
        </p>
    <li style="background-color: #C7EEFF;"><b>As a grad student (Masters, Ph.D.), what are the expectation of work during my degree?</b></li>
        <p>
            For <b>masters students</b> in NYCU College of Computing, you would have many options to explore during your study. However, most people typically focus on these three - (1) leading a thesis research project, (2) seeking and preparing for landing a position afterwards (either in academia or industry), and (3) fulfilling course requirements. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As your advisor, I'm always happy to help you navigate them in any ways useful. However, we will spend most of the time focusing on your thesis research project. Our goal will be to have your project ready for publication in a top-tier HCI venue of interests. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For <b>Ph.D. students</b>, a Ph.D. degree requires a longer commitment, which would typically be over the course of 4-6 years. To very briefly sums it up - it would lead to the development of you as a researcher, through finishing a large dissertation project of yours. If you're interested, please set up a time with me and we can have a longer chat about it.
        </p>
    <li style="background-color: #C7EEFF;"><b>As an undergrad student, what can I expect to get from working with you?</b></li>
        <p>
            Undergraduate students from across disciplines join the lab during times across the year, often with different goals and skillsets. Some wish to gain research experiences and explore a potential research career, some wanted to acquire technical skills through working on projects, while others wanted to do design works or conduct user research in the interest of building up a portfolio. Based on the current projects that we’re working on, we will have multiple openings during the years for these roles.

            If you’re interested to join the team, reach out to me with your current CV/resume. We will have a chat about your goals, skills, and plans, to ensure that I would be the most helpful for you. 
        </p>
    <li style="background-color: #C7EEFF;"><b>How do I know you're a good fit for being my advisor / mentor?</b></li>
        <p>
            A good fit often considers many factors - personal goal alignment, research interest alignment, working style, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you've been asking this question, I appreciate your mindfulness and would be more than happy to schedule a chat about it before we mutually committed to each other during the next 1-3 years.
