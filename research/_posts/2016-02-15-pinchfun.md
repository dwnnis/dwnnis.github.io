project_name: Designing Fine Motor Training Game for Preschool Children with Developmental Delay
project_description: >
    Children with developmental delayed can make progress through early intervention and training. However, from the interviews with occupational therapists and parents, we found that current training techniques lack variety and bore children in a short while. To improve the training effect, we proposed PinchFun, a cooperative game aiming to provide fine motor training for preschool children (under 6 years old) with developmental delay, in which the parent can cooperate with the child to achieve the game goals and adjust the game difficulty to meet different developmental milestones. The game employs the Leap motion controller and force-sensitive resistor (FSR) to detect the hand gesture and level of pressure of fingers. PinchFun integrates the physical assistive devices, i.e. clips and rubber band, and the virtual interactive game to optimize learning impact and gaming experience.
