project_name: Incorporating Personal Informatics Data in Everyday Sharing on Ephemeral Social Media
project_description: >
     Sharing personal informatics data on social media has many benefits to the sharer. However, the sharer often worries that these activities and accomplishments are too trivial to share. The audience might not receive it as the sharer expected. Ephemeral social media are potentially valuable for sharing personal informatics data as people would be more comfortable sharing trivial and mundane content on it. Designing a sharing feature that incorporates playfulness and expressivity by allowing people to customize a data-driven sticker for sharing could potentially support interesting interaction between individuals with their connections. In this project, we plan to conduct a field study with an authoring app that enables ephemeral social media users with an interest in sharing personal informatics data to freely explore how they could incorporate data in their everyday sharing.
